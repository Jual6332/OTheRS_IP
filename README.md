# OTheRS_IP
Image processing and software repository for OTheRS project.

## Main Software Tasks:
1. Capture image (FLIR Lepton)
2. Image Correction (OpenCV: Ohr's thresholding, adaptive thresh., reducing pixel strecth)
3. Image Stitching and Image transformation(ORB, OpenCV)
4. Geometric calibration (OpenCV)
5. Calculate temp. at pixel locations (FLIR calibration technique, 14-bit)
6. 2-point Temp. Calibration
7. Output to CSV, temp table
