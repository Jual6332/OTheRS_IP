% linear_odefn: Linearized model of the heater dynamics
% Arguments:
%          t:          Timestep, seconds
%          y:          Ode45's state vector, this only only contains delta T, the
%                      temperature difference from the point linearized about
%          m:          Mass of the heater, kg
%          cp:         Specific heat
%          T0:         Temperature which to linearize about
%          Kc:         Conduction heat loss coeff
%          Kr:         Radiation heat loss coeff
%          control_fn: closed loop control function, of the
%                      form Qdot_in = control_fn(dT, t)
